# NOTE: Enable remote control so external programs (e.g. sketchybar) can query Kitty.

# sketchybar) run `kitten @ --to unix:/tmp/kitty-<pid>` and retrieve titles.
# The actual socket will be created as /tmp/kitty-<pid>.

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the

# NOTE: The neovide cursor type in kitty came during a YouTube livestream by
# user "Carlos Medina"
#
#: The cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline. Note that
#: when reloading the config this will be changed only if the cursor
#: shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal. This
#: sets the default cursor shape, applications running in the terminal
#: can override it. In particular, shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> in kitty sets
#: the cursor shape to beam at shell prompts. You can avoid this by
#: setting shell_integration to no-cursor.

#: The thickness of the beam cursor (in pts).

# Set this to a value larger than zero to enable a “cursor trail” animation. This is an animation that shows a “trail” following the movement of the text cursor. It makes it easy to follow large cursor jumps and makes for a cool visual effect of the cursor zooming around the screen. The actual value of this option controls when the animation is triggered. It is a number of milliseconds. The trail animation only follows cursors that have stayed in their position for longer than the specified number of milliseconds. This prevents trails from appearing for cursors that rapidly change their positions during UI updates in complex applications. See cursor_trail_decay to control the animation speed and cursor_trail_start_threshold to control when a cursor trail is started.
cursor_trail 1

# Controls the decay times for the cursor trail effect when the cursor_trail is enabled. This option accepts two positive float values specifying the fastest and slowest decay times in seconds. The first value corresponds to the fastest decay time (minimum), and the second value corresponds to the slowest decay time (maximum). The second value must be equal to or greater than the first value. Smaller values result in a faster decay of the cursor trail. Adjust these values to control how quickly the cursor trail fades away.
# cursor_trail_decay 0.1 0.6
cursor_trail_decay 0.1 0.4

# Set the distance threshold for starting the cursor trail. This option accepts a positive integer value that represents the minimum number of cells the cursor must move before the trail is started. When the cursor moves less than this threshold, the trail is skipped, reducing unnecessary cursor trail animation.
cursor_trail_start_threshold 1
